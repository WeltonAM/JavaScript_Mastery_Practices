## ðŸ“š About This Repository

This is my **personal learning space**, focused on mastering **React Native** and related technologies like backend APIs, TypeScript, and mobile tooling... through hands-on practice.

Rather than reading docs or watching tutorials passively, I build real applications by following along with high-quality tutorials from the channels.

## ðŸš€ Stacks in Practice

Each project explores specific technologies and architectural patterns:

| Stack                   | Use Case                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **TypeScript**          | Typed code for better developer experience |
| **React Native**        | Mobile development                         |
| **React.js**            | Web UI components and SPAs                 |
| **Next.js**             | Fullstack apps with SSR / API routes       |
| **NestJS**              | Backend services and REST APIs             |
| **Tailwind CSS**        | Styling across all apps                    |
| **Appwrite / Firebase** | Backend-as-a-Service, auth, storage        |
| **REST API**            | Real-world API integrations                |

## ðŸ§  Why This Approach?

âœ… **Hands-On Learning**  
Learning by building real apps cements your understanding much better than reading docs alone.

âœ… **Up-to-Date Stack**  
All technologies used here are in-demand and widely used in production environments.

âœ… **Portfolio-Ready**  
These projects are not toy examples â€” they can be extended into real portfolio pieces or even MVPs.
