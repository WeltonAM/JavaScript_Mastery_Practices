## ðŸ“š About This Repository

This repository documents my journey of **learning JavaScript and TypeScript** through real-world projects â€” ranging from full-stack apps to mobile-first experiences. Every project here is built while following along with detailed and high-quality tutorials on the [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery/videos) channel.

Rather than theory, this approach focuses on **learning by doing**, practicing the most used modern web and mobile technologies in a structured way.

## ðŸš€ Stacks in Practice

Each project explores specific technologies and architectural patterns:

| Stack                   | Use Case                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **TypeScript**          | Typed code for better developer experience |
| **React Native**        | Mobile development                         |
| **React.js**            | Web UI components and SPAs                 |
| **Next.js**             | Fullstack apps with SSR / API routes       |
| **NestJS**              | Backend services and REST APIs             |
| **Tailwind CSS**        | Styling across all apps                    |
| **Appwrite / Firebase** | Backend-as-a-Service, auth, storage        |
| **REST API**            | Real-world API integrations                |

## ðŸ§  Why This Approach?

âœ… **Hands-On Learning**  
Learning by building real apps cements your understanding much better than reading docs alone.

âœ… **Up-to-Date Stack**  
All technologies used here are in-demand in 2024/2025 and widely used in production environments.

âœ… **Instructor-Led**  
Guided by [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery/videos), one of the best learning resources for JavaScript developers.

âœ… **Portfolio-Ready**  
These projects are not toy examples â€” they can be extended into real portfolio pieces or even MVPs.
