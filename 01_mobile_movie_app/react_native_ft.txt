ðŸš€ JSI - JavaScript Interface
A lightweight, faster alternative to the traditional React Native bridge. It allows direct, synchronous communication between JavaScript and native code (Java/Kotlin for Android, Objective-C/Swift for iOS), without relying on JSON serialization or the bridge queue.

This enables better performance and opens the door for more advanced features like Fabric and TurboModules.

âš¡ TurboModules
An enhancement to the native module system in React Native. Unlike the old system where all native modules are loaded at app startup, TurboModules are lazily loaded â€” meaning they are only loaded when needed, improving startup performance.

TurboModules also take advantage of JSI to allow faster method calls between JS and native code.

ðŸŽ¨ Fabric
The new rendering architecture in React Native that improves performance and consistency in UI updates. It replaces the old React Native renderer and enables:

Synchronous rendering with the native UI thread

Better support for concurrent rendering (aka React 18â€™s Concurrent Mode)

More efficient UI updates via Shadow Trees and JSI

Itâ€™s built to be more flexible and performant for complex UI use cases and tight integration with native views.

ðŸ’¡ Summary (TL;DR)
Concept	         What it Improves	        How It Works
JSI	         JS â†” Native communication	Direct calls, no bridge serialization
TurboModules 	 Native module loading	        Lazy loading + JSI = faster startup
Fabric	         UI rendering	                New renderer using JSI for efficiency
